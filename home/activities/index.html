						<p>I teach statistics, data science, and statistical programming at Utrecht
University. I also give workshops on these subjects.</p>
<h3 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h3>
<p>Teaching is great! I&rsquo;ve been doing some form of teaching since my days as a
bachelor student, and teaching makes up the majority of my duties in my current
position at <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en">Utrecht University</a> (UU). Of course, teaching has obvious
altruistic benefits such as improving society by educating the citizenry and
&ldquo;paying forward&rdquo; all of the energy my own teachers and mentors put into training
me. In addition to these noble motivations, however, teaching also has plenty of
more self-serving benefits to appeal to those of us who may lean more toward the
anti-social side of the spectrum.</p>
<p>For example, teaching is great way to get new research ideas. If my students
repeatedly ask interesting questions for which the literature has no answers,
then I know there&rsquo;s probably demand for research on that topic. Depending on the
teaching context, I may even be able to recruit the curious students as
collaborators. If I take a broader view, I recognize that I am educating the
people who will shape the world in which I will grow old. So, it certainly
behooves me to train my students as well as possible. I&rsquo;m counting on these
folks to make the future a nice place to be.</p>
<p>One of my favorite benefits of teaching, though, is its effect on my own
learning. Like most academics, I&rsquo;m eternally curious and always eager to learn
new things. I suppose I stuck around academia after graduate school largely
because I wasn&rsquo;t ready to give up on being a student. I&rsquo;m rarely satisfied with
using a tool that &ldquo;just works&rdquo;; I want to know how and why the tool works, and
teaching is an excellent way to facilitate this kind of deep learning. In my
experience, the best way to master a subject is to put yourself in a position
where you must teach that subject to others. In this sense, I completely agree
with the sentiment variously attributed to Albert Einstein, Richard Feynman, and
Ernest Rutherford:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You do not really understand something unless you can explain it to your
grandmother.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All things considered, if we&rsquo;re meant to leave the world a better place than we
found it (which seems like a pretty good goal to me), then devoting a
considerable portion of my energy to education seems like a good use of the
limited time I have to hang out on this planet.</p>
<h3 id="experience">Experience</h3>
<p>I first dipped my toe in the teaching waters by tutoring statistics as a
bachelor student. In graduate school, I worked as a teaching assistant in the
statistics courses given by the <a href="https://www.ku.edu/">University of Kansas</a> <a href="https://quantitative.ku.edu/">Quantitative
Psychology Program</a>. During that time, I also taught short seminars on
missing data and worked as a teaching assistant for the <a href="https://www.statscamp.org/">Stats Camp</a>
workshop series run by YHat Enterprises.</p>
<p>During my postdoc at <a href="https://www.ttu.edu/">Texas Tech University</a>, I developed and taught my
first full-scale courses. These master-level courses covered missing data
analysis, Monte Carlo simulation methods, and conditional process analysis. I
went on to teach statistics and data science courses to bachelor students in the
<a href="https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/education/bachelors-programs/psychology">Psychological Methods and Data Science</a> major and master students in the
<a href="https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/education/masters-programmes/data-science-and-society">Data Science and Society</a> program during my first faculty appointment as
an assistant professor at <a href="https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/">Tilburg University</a>.</p>
<p>I now teach courses on statistics, data science, and statistical programming in
the <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en/research/applied-data-science">Applied Data Science</a> program and various master and bachelor programs
of the <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/faculty-of-social-and-behavioural-sciences">Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences</a> at UU. I also teach in
the <a href="https://utrechtsummerschool.nl/">Utrecht Summer School</a>, and give workshops for UU students and staff.</p>

						<p>I primarily study methods for missing data treatment. I also collaborate
extensively with social-, behavioral-, and health-scientists.</p>
<p>My research generally falls into one of two broad categories: methodological
work developing and evaluating methods to treat missing data or collaborations
with substantive researchers from the social-, behavioral-, and health-sciences.</p>
<p>In my methodological work, I mostly explore ways of treating missing data (i.e.,
data with values in the population but unobserved entries in the
sample). Missing values cause myriad problems for statistical modeling,
inference, and prediction, so treating missing data is a crucial step in any
data analysis. Currently, my work focuses on developing and evaluating <em>multiple
imputation</em> techniques. In particular, I am interested in ways of simplifying the
process of specifying the underlying imputation models.</p>
<p>In my substantive collaborations, I provide statistical expertise to research
teams from social-, behavioral-, and health-sciences. For example, in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10888691.2020.1760868">this
project</a>, I helped design a novel planned missing data protocol for
non-survey data; in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1049731516669822">this project</a>, I helped evaluate the efficacy of the
<em>Kansas Intensive Permanency Project</em>, and in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0165025415591230">this project</a>, I helped
develop norms for the <em>Supports Intensity Scale</em>. I particularly enjoy
collaboration because I like contributing to a group effort, and the diversity
of research topics keeps things interesting. As such, I have to agree with John
Tukey&rsquo;s purported quip:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best thing about being a statistician is that you get to play in
everyone’s backyard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I strive to follow open-science principles in my work. So, open-access flavors of
most of my published work are available via the <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en/university-library/advice-support-to/researchers/publishing-support/open-access/how-does-it-work/the-green-route">Utrecht University

						<p>A lot of the research and consulting work I do involves intensive statistical
computing. I also dabble a bit in R development.</p>
<h3 id="statistical-computing">Statistical Computing</h3>
<p>If I had to give myself an academic label, it would probably be &ldquo;computational
statistician&rdquo;. A great deal of my work revolves around statistical computing. In
my methodological research, I use Monte Carlo simulation as the primary tool by
which to explore the performance of the methods I&rsquo;m developing or evaluating. As
these methods tend to be some flavor of multiple imputation&mdash;which is already
computationally intensive&mdash;these simulations often place prohibitive demands on
computing resources. Hence, I have become a serial abuser of high-performance
computing (HPC) clusters such as the <a href="https://www.surf.nl/en/lisa-compute-cluster-extra-processing-power-for-research">Lisa Compute Cluster</a>. My eternal
gratitude goes out to the folks at <a href="https://www.surf.nl/en">SURF</a> who administer Lisa and many
similar services and provide excellent support for their products.</p>
<p>Likewise, most of my collaborative work is computational. In my experience,
substantive researchers don&rsquo;t need statistical experts to help them run t-tests
or simple linear models, but these simple methods are often inadequate. As my
coauthors and I argue in <a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1080/15427609.2017.1371567">this paper</a>, plausible representations of modern
social-scientific theories&mdash;and reasonable tests of the associated
hypotheses&mdash;often require advanced modeling approaches such as structural
equation modeling, multilevel modeling, conditional process analysis, or
Bayesian modeling. Similarly, when working with messy real-world data, the
asymptotic assumptions underlying simple, traditional statistical tools are
often grossly violated. In such cases, computationally intensive methods like
cross-validation or resampling methods (e.g., bootstrapping, permutation tests)
are often required to support reasonable statistical modeling, inference, and
prediction.</p>
<h3 id="development">Development</h3>
<p>As a natural consequence of spending so much of my time immersed in statistical
computation, I also dabble in software development, particularly R package
development. I created my first R package (<a href="https://github.com/kylelang/MIBRR">MIBRR</a>) after realizing that
my life would be much easier if I packaged the code I was using to implement the
imputation algorithm I was developing for my PhD project. During my postdoc at
<a href="https://www.ttu.edu/">Texas Tech University</a>, one of my primary tasks was developing the
<a href="https://github.com/PcAux-Package/PcAux">PcAux</a> R package. After a few more people joined the PcAux project, I
took on the role of development team lead.</p>
<p>I have also done a few non-statistical programming projects such as <a href="https://github.com/kylelang/TiU-Exam-Merge">this
utility</a> that I developed for the <a href="https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/">Tilburg University</a> Student
Administration to merge the results from the online and on-campus versions of
hybrid exams.</p>
<p>Pretty much all of my potentially interesting programming/development work lives
on <a href="https://github.com/kylelang/">my GitHub page</a>. If you would like to contribute to any of my
projects, feel free to submit a pull request.</p>

						<p>I offer professional statistical consulting as part of the Department of
Methodology and Statistics Consultancy program.</p>
<p>I took my first forays into statistical consulting near the end of my bachelor
studies when I had the opportunity to debug and improve some of my supervisor&rsquo;s
structural equation models. During graduate school, I worked for the <a href="https://www.ku.edu/">University
of Kansas</a> (KU) Center for Research Methods and Data Analysis (CRMDA). Under
the auspices of the CRMDA, I had the opportunity to work on several interesting
projects including subcontracting to the US Army/Human Terrain System to provide
statistical/data analytic support to Army units deployed in Afghanistan. I
funded the final year of my PhD through very productive consultant/collaborator
positions in the lab groups of Tom McDonald/<a href="https://socwel.ku.edu/people/faculty/akin-becci">Becci Akin</a> and <a href="https://specialedu.ku.edu/karrie-shogren">Karrie
Shogren</a>.</p>
<p>After graduate school, I did a postdoc focusing on statistical consulting in the
Institute for Measurement, Methodology, Analysis, and Policy (IMMAP) at <a href="https://www.ttu.edu/">Texas
Tech University</a>. During my time at IMMAP, I was involved in several
projects including working with CDC scientists to analyze the data from a large
RCT evaluating the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/intimatepartnerviolence/datingmatters/index.html">Dating Matters</a>® program and leading the development
team for the <a href="https://github.com/PcAux-Package/PcAux">PcAux</a> R package.</p>
<p>As an assistant professor&mdash;first at <a href="https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/">Tilburg University</a> and now at
<a href="https://www.uu.nl/en/">Utrecht University</a> (UU)&mdash;I have continued my consulting work. I currently
offer statistical consulting to UU students and staff as part of the
<a href="https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/methodology-and-statistics/training-and-support/consultation-researchers">Statistical Consultancy Program</a> from the <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/methodology-and-statistics">Department of Methodology
and Statistics</a>.</p>
<p>Since graduate school, I have also done freelance statistical consulting on an
independent basis. Due to contractual restrictions, however, all current
consulting work must be officially routed through my role at UU.</p>
