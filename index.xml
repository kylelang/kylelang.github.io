      <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of the research and consulting work I do involves intensive statistical
computing. I also dabble a bit in R development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Who am I? I am an assistant professor in the Department of Methodology and Statistics at Utrecht University (UU). Although I now live and work in the Netherlands, I was born and raised in the United States. I received my PhD in Quantitative Psychology from the University of Kansas. I then completed a two-year postdoc at Texas Tech University (TTU). My postdoc focused on statistical consulting, and I was able to hone the consulting skills that I began to develop during graduate school.</description>

      <description>I also enjoy (non-outdoor) traveling and taking &amp;ldquo;city trips&amp;rdquo; with my wife and daughter. Such trips are always welcome as they allow me indulge my passion for trying new foods (or simply eating a bunch of those with which I am already familiar). When I&amp;rsquo;m stuck inside and at home, I enjoy weight training, reading (particularly science fiction and adventure), and chess.</description>

      <description>Development Much of my work involves computationally intensive applications of data processing/analysis, so I spend a lot of my time on statistical computing. As a natural byproduct of this work, I dabble in software development, particularly R package development. To find our more, go here.
Consulting Beginning as early as the final years of my bachelor studies, statistical consultancy has been an integral part of my career. In graduate school, I had the opportunity to work on several interesting projects, and consulting became the focus of my work during my postdoc.</description>

      <description>Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague, than the exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise.
